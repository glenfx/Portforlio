      "description": "Explained: <h2>Critical RCE Vulnerability in React & Next.js.</h2> Modern web development just faced its Log4Shell moment. On December 3, 2025, a critical security vulnerability in React Server Components (RSC) was publicly disclosed: 👉 CVE-2025–55182, nicknamed React2Shell, enables unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE) against servers running vulnerable React and Next.js applications — with a CVSS score of 10.0, the highest possible severity. This bug allows attackers to execute arbitrary commands on servers with nothing more than a single crafted HTTP request — no credentials, no special configuration, and no indicators by default.<br><br> <b>Why This Is So Dangerous </b> <br>React Server Components (introduced in React 19) allow rendering parts of a React application on the server for better performance and smaller client bundles. <br><br> However, the architecture depends on streaming serialized payloads over the <b>“React Flight” protocol </b>— and that’s exactly where things went wrong. <br><br> A flaw in deserialization logic allows malicious payloads to: <br><br> <ul><li>Manipulate JavaScript prototypes,</li><br><li>Resolve dangerous Node.js modules such as child_process,</li><br> <li>Trigger functions capable of executing system commands.</li></ul><br> The vulnerable path centers around a function called:  <b>requireModule()</b><br> <br><b> The Reality: Exploitation Within Hours</b> <br>This vulnerability didn’t sit unnoticed. Within hours of public disclosure, threat intelligence teams observed: <b>Active exploitation</b> China-aligned groups including: <b>Earth Lamia AND Jackpot Panda</b> began scanning and exploiting exposed RSC endpoints globally.<br><br><b>Captured attacks included:</b> <ul><li>Credential harvesting via dumping .env files.</li> <li>Host reconnaissance using whoami, uname, id.</li><li>Persistence attempts by writing files under /tmp/.</li></ul> <br> Public proof-of-concept exploits were released on GitHub on December 4–5,achieving 100% success against clean default installs of create-next-app.",
