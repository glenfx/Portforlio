<p><strong>Explained:</strong> Critical RCE Vulnerability in React & Next.js.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Modern web development just faced its Log4Shell moment. On December 3, 2025, a critical vulnerability in React Server Components (RSC) was publicly disclosed: CVE-2025-55182, nicknamed React2Shell. The flaw enables unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE) against servers running vulnerable React and Next.js applications, earning a CVSS score of 10.0 — the highest possible severity.</p>

<p>This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary system commands using a single crafted HTTP request — no authentication required.</p>

<h2>Why This Is So Dangerous</h2>
<p>React Server Components, introduced in React 19, allow portions of applications to render server-side for performance optimization. However, this architecture relies on streaming serialized payloads via the <strong>React Flight protocol</strong>.</p>

<p>The vulnerability stems from flawed deserialization logic, allowing malicious payloads to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Manipulate JavaScript prototypes</li>
<li>Resolve dangerous Node.js modules such as <code>child_process</code></li>
<li>Execute system-level commands on the host server</li>
</ul>

<p>The vulnerable execution path centers around a function named <code>requireModule()</code>.</p>

<h2>Exploitation in the Wild</h2>
<p>This vulnerability was exploited within hours of disclosure. Threat intelligence reports confirmed active exploitation by China-aligned groups including <strong>Earth Lamia</strong> and <strong>Jackpot Panda</strong>.</p>

<h3>Observed Attack Activity</h3>
<ul>
<li>Credential harvesting by dumping <code>.env</code> files</li>
<li>Host reconnaissance using <code>whoami</code>, <code>uname</code>, and <code>id</code></li>
<li>Persistence attempts via file writes to <code>/tmp/</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Public proof-of-concept exploits were released on GitHub within 24 hours, achieving near 100% success against default <code>create-next-app</code> installations.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>CVE-2025-55182 represents a critical security failure in modern server-rendered React architectures. Immediate patching and endpoint hardening are essential to prevent full server compromise.</p>"
