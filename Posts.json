      "descriptiot": "<h1>React2Shell CVE-2025-55182</h1><h2>Introduction</h2><p>Modern web development just faced its Log4Shell moment. On December 3, 2025, a critical security vulnerability in React Server Components (RSC) was publicly disclosed: CVE-2025-55182, nicknamed React2Shell. The vulnerability enables unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE) against servers running vulnerable React and Next.js applications with a CVSS score of 10.0.</p><p>This bug allows attackers to execute arbitrary commands on servers using a single crafted HTTP request — no credentials, no special configuration, and no default logging indicators.</p><h2>Why This Is So Dangerous</h2><p>React Server Components (introduced in React 19) allow parts of applications to render on the server for improved performance and smaller client bundles. However, the architecture relies on streaming serialized payloads over the React Flight protocol.</p><p>A flaw in the deserialization logic allows malicious payloads to:</p><ul><li>Manipulate JavaScript prototypes</li><li>Resolve dangerous Node.js modules such as child_process</li><li>Trigger functions capable of executing system commands</li></ul><p>The vulnerable execution path centers around a function named <strong>requireModule()</strong>.</p><h2>Exploitation in the Wild</h2><p>This vulnerability was exploited within hours of disclosure. Threat intelligence teams observed active exploitation from China-aligned groups including Earth Lamia and Jackpot Panda.</p><p>Captured attacks included:</p><ul><li>Credential harvesting through dumping .env files</li><li>Host reconnaissance using whoami, uname, and id</li><li>Persistence attempts by writing malicious files under /tmp/</li></ul><p>Public proof-of-concept exploits were released on GitHub on December 4–5, achieving full success against default create-next-app installations.</p><h2>Mitigation</h2><ul><li>Immediately upgrade to patched React and Next.js versions</li><li>Disable exposed React Server Component endpoints if not required</li><li>Restrict server execution permissions</li><li>Implement runtime monitoring for abnormal module loading</li></ul><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>React2Shell demonstrates how serialization and deserialization flaws can introduce catastrophic server-side vulnerabilities. Organizations must treat server component architectures as part of their critical attack surface and apply strict input validation and dependency management practices.</p>"
